            They were turned down by at least five record labels before signing
            with EMI in June of 1962.During 1962 and 1963, they became increasingly popular in Europe. 
            And then came their American debut in early 1964 and the beginning of their worldwide popularity.
            Their popularity in the UK grew in 1961 and 1962. 
            In January 1963, they were rejected by Decca with the criticism “Guitar groups are on the way out.”
            In August 1963, “She Loves You” became their first hit song.They left Heathrow Airport on February 7, 1964, to fly to New York City. 
            Two days later, their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show was watched by approximately 40 percent of the US population.

          <h2>Cultural Influeneces</h2>
          <p>
            Many cultural movements of the 1960s were assisted or inspired by
            the Beatles. In Britain, their rise to national prominence signalled
            the youth-driven changes in postwar society, with respect to social
            mobility, teenagers' commercial influence, and informality. They
            spearheaded the shift from American artists' global dominance of
            rock and roll to British acts (known in the US as the British
            Invasion) and inspired many young people to pursue music careers.
            they made their American debut, which marked the start of their
            global fame

          <h3>Documentary</h1>
          <p>The Beatles: Get Back is a 2021 documentary series directed and produced by Peter Jackson. 
            It covers the making of the Beatles' 1970 album Let It Be, which had the working title of Get Back, 
            and draws from material originally captured for Michael Lindsay-Hogg's 1970 documentary of the album. 
            Originally conceived as a feature film, The Beatles: Get Back consists of three episodes with runtimes between two and three hours each, resulting in a total runtime of nearly eight hours of material. 
            The series is presented by Walt Disney Studios in association with Apple Corps and WingNut Films.
